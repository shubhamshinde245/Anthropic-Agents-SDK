    "Our Spatial Data Platform\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "Our technology platform uses spatial data collected from a wide variety of digital capture devices to transform physical buildings and spaces into dimensionally accurate, photorealistic digital twins that provide our subscribers access to previously unavailable building information and insights.\n",
    "As a first mover in this massive market for nearly a decade, we have developed and scaled our industry-leading 3D reconstruction technology powered by Cortex, our proprietary AI-driven software engine that uses machine learning to recreate a photorealistic, 3D virtual representation of an entire building structure, including contents, equipment and furnishings. The finished product is a detailed and dynamic replication of the physical space that can be explored, analyzed and customized from a web browser on any device, including smartphones. The power to manage even large-scale commercial buildings is in the palm of each subscriber’s hands, made possible by our advanced technology and breakthrough innovations across our entire spatial data technology stack.\n",
    "Key elements of our spatial data platform include:\n",
    "•Bringing offline buildings online. Traditionally, our customers needed to conduct in-person site visits to understand and assess their buildings and spaces. While photographs and floor plans can be helpful, these forms of two-dimensional (“2D”) representation have limited information and tend to be static and rigid, and thus lack the interactive element critical to a holistic understanding of each building and space. With the AI-powered capabilities of Cortex, our proprietary AI software, representation of physical objects is no longer confined to static 2D images and physical visits can be eliminated. Cortex helps to move the buildings and spaces from offline to online and makes them accessible to our customers in real-time and on demand from anywhere. After subscribers scan their buildings, our visualization algorithms accurately infer spatial positions and depths from flat, 2D imagery captured through the scans and transform them into high- fidelity and precise digital twin models. This creates a fully automated image processing pipeline to ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality.\n",
    "•Driven by spatial data. We are a data-driven company. Each incremental capture of a space grows the richness and depth of our spatial data library. Spatial data represents the unique and idiosyncratic details that underlie and compose the buildings and spaces in the human- made environment. Cortex uses the breadth of the billions of data points we have accumulated over the years to improve the 3D accuracy of our digital twins. We help our subscribers pinpoint the height, location and other characteristics of objects in their digital twin. Our sophisticated algorithms also deliver significant commercial value to our subscribers by generating data-based insights that allow them to confidently make assessments and decisions about their properties. For instance, property developers can assess the amount of natural heat and daylight coming from specific windows, retailers can ensure each store layout is up to the same level of code and brand requirements, and factories can insure machinery layouts meet specifications and location guidelines. With approximately 9.2 million spaces under management as of December 31, 2022, our spatial data library is the clearinghouse for information about the built world.\n",
    "•Powered by AI and ML. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies effectively utilize spatial data to create a robust virtual experience that is dynamic, realistic, interactive, informative and permits multiple viewing angles. AI and ML also make costly cameras unnecessary for everyday scans—subscribers can now scan their spaces by simply tapping a button on their smartphones. As a result, Matterport is a device agnostic platform, helping us more rapidly scale and drive towards our mission of digitizing and indexing the built world.\n",
    "Our value proposition to subscribers is designed to serve the entirety of the digital building lifecycle, from design and build to maintenance and operations, promotion, sale, lease, insure, repair, restore, secure and finance. As a result, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue with our subscribers as we help them to discover opportunities to drive short- and long-term return on investment by taking their buildings and spaces from offline to online across their portfolios of properties.\n",
    "Ubiquitous Capture\n",
    "Matterport has become the standard for 3D space capture. Our technology platform empowers subscribers worldwide to quickly, easily and accurately digitize, customize and manage interactive and dimensionally accurate digital twins of their buildings and spaces.\n",

    "•Matterport Pro3 is our newest 3D camera that scans properties faster than earlier versions to help accelerate project completion. Pro3 provides the highest accuracy scans of both indoor and outdoor spaces and is designed for speed, fidelity, versatility and accuracy. Capturing 3D data up to 100 meters away at less than 20 seconds per sweep, Pro3’s ultra-fast, high-precision LiDAR sensor can run for hours and takes millions of measurements in any conditions.\n",
    "•Matterport Pro2 is our proprietary 3D camera that has been used to capture millions of spaces around the world with a high degree of fidelity, precision, speed and simplicity. Capable of capturing buildings more than 500,000 square feet in size, it has become the camera of choice for many residential, commercial, industrial and large-scale properties.\n",
    "•360 Cameras. Matterport supports a selection of 360 cameras available in the market. These affordable, pocket sized devices deliver precision captures with high fidelity and are appropriate for capturing smaller homes, condos, short-term rentals, apartments, and more. The spherical lens image capture technology of these devices gives Cortex robust, detailed image data to transform panoramas into our industry-leading digital twins.\n",
    "•LEICA BLK360. Through our partnership with Leica, our 3D reconstruction technology and our AI powered software engine, Cortex, transform this powerful LiDAR camera into an ultra-precise capture device for creating Matterport digital twins. It is the solution of choice for AEC professionals when exacting precision is required.\n",
    "•Smartphone Capture. Our capture apps are commercially available for both iOS and Android. Matterport’s smartphone capture solution has democratized 3D capture, making it easy and accessible for anyone to digitize buildings and spaces with a recent iPhone device since the initial introduction of Matterport for iPhone in May 2020. In April 2021, we announced the official release of the Android Capture app, giving Android users the ability to quickly and easily capture buildings and spaces in immersive 3D. In February 2022, we launched Matterport Axis, a motorized mount that holds a smartphone and can be used with the Matterport Capture app to capture 3D digital twins of any physical space with increased speed, precision, and consistency.\n",
    "Cortex and 3D Reconstruction (the Matterport Digital Twin)\n",
    "With a spatial data library, as of December 31, 2022, of approximately 9.2 million spaces under management, representing approximately 28 billion captured square feet of space, we use our advanced ML and DL technologies to algorithmically transform the spatial data we capture into an accurate 3D digital reproduction of any physical space. This intelligent, automated 3D reconstruction is made possible by Cortex, our AI-powered software engine that includes a deep learning neural network that uses our spatial data library to understand how a building or space is divided into floors and rooms, where the doorways and openings are located, and what types of rooms are present, such that those forms are compiled and aligned with dimensional accuracy into a dynamic, photorealistic digital twin. Other components of Cortex include AI-powered computer vision technologies to identify and classify the contents inside a building or space, and object recognition technologies to identify and segment everything from furnishings and equipment to doors, windows, light fixtures, fire suppression sprinklers and fire escapes. Our highly scalable artificial intelligence platform enables our subscribers to tap into powerful, enhanced building data and insights at the click of a button.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Science Behind the Matterport Digital Twin: Cortex AI Highlights\n",
    "Matterport Runs on Cortex\n",
    "Cortex is our AI-powered software engine that includes a precision deep learning neural network to create digital twins of any building or space. Developed using our proprietary spatial data captured with our Pro2 and Pro3 cameras, Cortex delivers a high degree of precision and accuracy while enabling 3D capture using everyday devices.\n",
    "Generic neural networks struggle with 3D reconstruction of the real world. Matterport-optimized networks deliver more accurate and robust results. More than just raw training data, Matterport’s datasets allow us to develop new neural network architectures and evaluate them against user behavior and real-world data in millions of situations.\n",
    "•Deep learning: Connecting and optimizing the detailed neural network data architecture of each space is key to creating robust, highly accurate 3D digital twins. Cortex evaluates and optimizes each 3D model against Matterport’s rich spatial data aggregated from millions of buildings and spaces and the human annotations of those data provided by tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. Cortex’s evaluative abilities and its data-driven optimization of 3D reconstruction yield consistent, high-precision results across a wide array of building configurations, spaces and environments.\n",
    "•Dynamic 3D reconstruction: Creating precise 3D spatial data at scale from 2D visuals and static images requires a combination of photorealistic, detailed data from multiple viewpoints and millions of spaces that train and optimize Cortex’s neural network and learning capabilities for improved 3D reconstruction of any space. Cortex’s capabilities combined with real-time spatial alignment algorithms in our 3D capture technology create an intuitive “preview” of any work in progress, allowing subscribers to work with their content interactively and in real-time.\n",
    "•Computer vision: Cortex enables a suite of powerful features to enhance the value of digital twins. These include automatic measurements for rooms or objects in a room, automatic 2D-from-3D high-definition photo gallery creation, auto face blurring for privacy protection, custom videos, walkthroughs, auto room labeling and object recognition.\n",
    "•Advanced image processing: Matterport’s computational photography algorithms create a fully automated image processing pipeline to help ensure that each digital twin is of professional grade image quality. Our patented technology makes 3D capture as simple as pressing a single button. Matterport’s software and technology manage the remaining steps, including white balance and camera-specific color correction, high dynamic range tone mapping, de-noising, haze removal, sharpening, saturation and other adjustments to improve image quality.\n",
    "Spatial Data and AI-Powered Insights\n",
    "Every Matterport digital twin contains extensive information about a building, room or physical space. The data uses our AI-powered Cortex engine. In addition to the Matterport digital twin itself, our spatial data consists of precision building geometry and structural detail, building contents, fixtures and condition, along with high-definition imagery and photorealistic detail from many vantage points in a space. Cortex employs a technique we call deep spatial indexing. Deep spatial indexing uses artificial intelligence, computer vision and deep learning to identify and convey important details about each space, its structure and its contents with precision and fidelity. We have created a robust spatial data standard that enables Matterport subscribers to harness an interoperable digital system of record for any building.\n",
    "In addition to creating a highly interactive digital experience for subscribers through the construction of digital twins, we ask ourselves two questions for every subscriber: (1) what is important about their building or physical space and (2) what learnings and insights can we deliver for this space? Our AI-powered Cortex engine helps us answer these questions using our spatial data library to provide aggregated property trends and operational and valuation insights. Moreover, as the Matterport platform ecosystem continues to expand, our subscribers, partners and other third-party developers can bring their own tools to further the breadth and depth of insights they can harvest from our rich spatial data layer.\n",
    "Extensible Platform Ecosystem\n",
    "Matterport offers the largest and most accurate library of spatial data in the world, with, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.2 million spaces under management and approximately 28 billion captured square feet.

The tournament was played from April 11–14 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, United States. Scottie Scheffler won his second Masters and major, four strokes ahead of runner-up Ludvig Åberg, who was playing in his first major. Scheffler became the fourth-youngest two-time winner of the tournament and the second player, after Tiger Woods in 2001, to win both the Masters and The Players Championship in the same calendar year. \\n\\n\\n== Course ==\\n\\nThe only change to the course for the 2024 tournament was the lengthening of the second hole by ten yards.\\n\\n\\n== Field ==\\nParticipation in the Masters Tournament is by invitation only, and the tournament has the smallest field of the major championships. There are a number of criteria by which invitations are awarded, including all past winners, recent major champions, leading finishers in the previous year's majors, leading players on the PGA Tour in the previous season, winners of full-point tournaments on the PGA Tour during the previous 12 months, leading players in the Official World Golf Ranking, and some leading amateurs.\\n\\n\\n=== Criteria ===\\nThere were three changes to invitee criteria between the 2023 and 2024 tournaments. The first was to add the current NCAA Division I Men's Individual Champion a spot in the field, provided that he remains an amateur at the time of the tournament. In addition, Augusta National clarified that players who qualify for the Tour Championship must remain eligible to play in that event in order to qualify for the Masters. Also, with the PGA Tour returning to a calendar-year season schedule, Augusta National noted that winners of fall PGA Tour events would continue to qualify for the Masters.\\nThe below list details the qualification criteria for the 2024 Masters Tournament and the players who have qualified under them; any additional criteria under which players qualified are indicated in parentheses.\\n1.

There were five holes-in-one recorded, by Sepp Straka, Luke List, Gary Woodland, Viktor Hovland, and Lucas Glover.\\n\\n\\n== Round summaries ==\\n\\n\\n=== First round ===\\nThursday, April 11, 2024Friday, April 12, 2024\\nInclement weather delayed the start of the tournament until 10:30 am Eastern time. As a result, 27 players did not complete the first round on Thursday.\\nThe 8th hole, a par 5, saw a record-breaking total of 53 par-breaking scores, including 50 birdies and 3 eagles, the highest ever recorded on this hole in Masters history. \\n\\n\\n=== Second round ===\\nFriday, April 12, 2024\\nBy making the cut, Tiger Woods set the record for most consecutive cuts made at the Masters, at 24. Phil Mickelson made the cut for the 28th time, surpassing Raymond Floyd and Bernhard Langer to move into solo fourth place for most cuts made at the Masters, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (37), Fred Couples (31) and Gary Player (30).\\nRookie Ludvig Åberg posted the lowest score of the round, a 69, and advanced to a solo 7th place.\\nBryson DeChambeau, before making a birdie on the 13th hole, moved a large directional sign that was in his line of play.\\nPatrick Cantlay achieved two eagles on par 4s, marking only the fourth instance in history that a player has recorded two par-4 eagles in a single Masters Tournament, the last being Brandt Jobe in 2006.\\nThe cut came at 150 (+6), with 60 players advancing to the weekend. Notables to miss the cut included 2015 champion Jordan Spieth, 2020 champion Dustin Johnson, reigning U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark, Open champion Brian Harman, and World No. 6 Viktor Hovland. Two-time major champion Justin Thomas played his last four holes in seven-over to miss the cut by one shot.\\n\\n\\n=== Third round ===\\nSaturday, April 13, 2024\\nScottie Scheffler, beginning the round in a three-way tie for the lead, chipped in for birdie on the first hole. After a double bogey on the 10th, Scheffler holed a 31-foot eagle putt on the par-five 13th, the only eagle recorded on that hole during the round. He also birdied the 15th and 18th to finish at seven under following a 71 (−1) to take a one-shot lead into the final round.\\nCollin Morikawa birdied his first three holes in a three-under round of 69 and finished at six under, one shot back of Scheffler. Max Homa, tied for the lead at the start of the round, didn't make a birdie in a one-over 73 and fell two back at 5 under. Bryson DeChambeau was also atop the leaderboard to begin the round but hit his third shot in the water on the 15th and made double bogey. He holed out for birdie on the 18th to finish at three under and four shots back of Scheffler. Ludvig Åberg, making his Masters and major championship debut, was four under on his round until a bogey at the 14th. He then left his third shot on the 15th short and three-putted from just off the green for another bogey. He shot 70 (–2) and ended up at four under.\\nNicolai Højgaard moved into sole possession of the lead following a run of three straight birdies from holes 8 to 10, but he then made five straight bogeys including hitting into the water on both the 13th and 15th and finished at two under.\\nTiger Woods carded a 10-over-par 82 for the third round, his highest score ever in a major championship.\\nNo eagles were recorded on the par-5 15th hole through the first three rounds, marking only the second time in the past 50 years that No. 15 has failed to produce an eagle by this point in the tournament. Shane Lowry scored an eagle on the par-4 14th hole, marking the first eagle on this hole since Martin Kaymer in 2016.\\n\\n\\n=== Final round ===\\nSunday, April 14, 2024\\n\\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler shot a four-under 68 to win his second Masters title in the last three years by four shots over runner-up Ludvig Åberg.\\nScheffler began the round with a one-shot lead and birdied the third hole to go two shots ahead. He then bogeyed the fourth after hitting his tee shot over the green. Max Homa birdied the second, his first birdie in 34 holes, to get within one of the lead, while Åberg hit his approach on the seventh to four feet and made birdie to also get within one of the lead.\\nScheffler bogeyed the seventh to create a three-way tie with Åberg and Collin Morikawa at six under, while Homa joined the lead with a two-putt birdie at the par-five eighth. Both Scheffler and Morikawa birdied the eighth to get to seven under, while Åberg holed a 36-foot birdie putt on the ninth to again tie. Scheffler then hit his approach on the ninth to within a foot for another birdie to get to 8 under and again in sole possession of the lead going to the second nine.\\nAll three challengers then fell from contention. Morikawa hit his second shot on the ninth into a greenside bunker and couldn't advance on his third, ending up with a double bogey to fall three shots behind. He found the water on his approach at the 11th and made another double bogey. Åberg also hit into the water on the 11th for a double bogey. Homa got back within one with a close approach to the 10th, but his tee shot on the 12th flew over the green into the bushes and he was forced to take a drop. He made a double bogey on the hole to fall three shots behind.\\nScheffler birdied the 10th, his third birdie in a row, to get to nine under and open a two-shot lead. Despite a bogey on the 11th, Scheffler two-putted for birdie at the par-five 13th and hit his second shot on the 14th to within four feet for another birdie to reach 10 under. He then made a nine-foot birdie putt on the par-three 16th to get to 11 under. Pars on his final two holes allowed him to close out the tournament with a four-shot victory.\\nÅberg birdied the 13th and 14th to get back to seven under and finish four back of Scheffler in his Masters and major championship debut. Morikawa and Homa both finished at four under for the tournament, in a tie for third place along with Tommy Fleetwood.\\n\\n\\n==== Scorecard ====\\n\\nCumulative tournament scores, relative to par\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\"}]}"

He shot 70 (–2) and ended up at four under.\\nNicolai Højgaard moved into sole possession of the lead following a run of three straight birdies from holes 8 to 10, but he then made five straight bogeys including hitting into the water on both the 13th and 15th and finished at two under.\\nTiger Woods carded a 10-over-par 82 for the third round, his highest score ever in a major championship.\\nNo eagles were recorded on the par-5 15th hole through the first three rounds, marking only the second time in the past 50 years that No. 15 has failed to produce an eagle by this point in the tournament. Shane Lowry scored an eagle on the par-4 14th hole, marking the first eagle on this hole since Martin Kaymer in 2016.\\n\\n\\n=== Final round ===\\nSunday, April 14, 2024\\n\\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler shot a four-under 68 to win his second Masters title in the last three years by four shots over runner-up Ludvig Åberg.\\nScheffler began the round with a one-shot lead and birdied the third hole to go two shots ahead. He then bogeyed the fourth after hitting his tee shot over the green. Max Homa birdied the second, his first birdie in 34 holes, to get within one of the lead, while Åberg hit his approach on the seventh to four feet and made birdie to also get within one of the lead.\\nScheffler bogeyed the seventh to create a three-way tie with Åberg and Collin Morikawa at six under, while Homa joined the lead with a two-putt birdie at the par-five eighth. Both Scheffler and Morikawa birdied the eighth to get to seven under, while Åberg holed a 36-foot birdie putt on the ninth to again tie. Scheffler then hit his approach on the ninth to within a foot for another birdie to get to 8 under and again in sole possession of the lead going to the second nine.\\nAll three challengers then fell from contention. Morikawa hit his second shot on the ninth into a greenside bunker and couldn't advance on his third, ending up with a double bogey to fall three shots behind. He found the water on his approach at the 11th and made another double bogey. Åberg also hit into the water on the 11th for a double bogey. Homa got back within one with a close approach to the 10th, but his tee shot on the 12th flew over the green into the bushes and he was forced to take a drop. He made a double bogey on the hole to fall three shots behind.\\nScheffler birdied the 10th, his third birdie in a row, to get to nine under and open a two-shot lead. Despite a bogey on the 11th, Scheffler two-putted for birdie at the par-five 13th and hit his second shot on the 14th to within four feet for another birdie to reach 10 under. He then made a nine-foot birdie putt on the par-three 16th to get to 11 under. Pars on his final two holes allowed him to close out the tournament with a four-shot victory.\\nÅberg birdied the 13th and 14th to get back to seven under and finish four back of Scheffler in his Masters and major championship debut. Morikawa and Homa both finished at four under for the tournament, in a tie for third place along with Tommy Fleetwood.\\n\\n\\n==== Scorecard ====\\n\\nCumulative tournament scores, relative to par\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\"}]}]"

It follows the love triangle among an injured tennis star-turned-coach (Zendaya), her low-circuit tennis player ex-boyfriend (Josh O\\'Connor), and her tennis champion husband (Mike Faist) across 13 years of their relationship, culminating in the match between the two men on the ATP Challenger Tour.\\nKuritzkes\\' screenplay was acquired by MGM in February 2022, with the main cast and Guadagnino being hired shortly after; Zendaya, O\\'Connor, and Faist trained for months with former tennis player and coach Brad Gilbert to prepare for their roles. Principal photography ran from May to June 2022, primarily in Boston. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, who previously worked with Guadagnino on Call Me by Your Name (2017) and Suspiria (2018), served as cinematographer.\\nDelayed from an initial September 2023 release in response to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, Challengers premiered in Sydney on March 26, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States by Amazon MGM Studios one month later. It grossed $96 million worldwide and received critical acclaim. Among the film\\'s accolades were four nominations at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy), where it won Best Original Score.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\n\\nIn 2006, best friends Patrick Zweig and Art Donaldson win the boys\\' junior doubles title at the US Open. They watch Tashi Duncan, a rising star, win the girls\\' junior singles final, and both Patrick and Art become infatuated with her. After meeting at a party, Tashi joins Art and Patrick in their hotel room, where all three kiss before Tashi abruptly ends the tryst. She promises to give her phone number to whoever wins the boys\\' singles final the next day. When Art asks what she wants out of the match, she states she\\'d want \"to watch some good fucking tennis.\" Patrick wins the match, and later signals to Art that he had sex with Tashi by placing the ball in the neck of his racket prior to serving, a tell of Art\\'s.\\nIn 2007, Tashi and Art play college tennis at Stanford University, while Patrick turns professional and begins a long-distance relationship with Tashi. Art suggests to Tashi that Patrick does not love her. When Patrick visits Stanford, Art similarly suggests to him that Tashi does not take the relationship seriously. Tashi and Patrick have an argument over her attempts to coach Patrick in tennis, and Patrick skips her match as a result; while playing, Tashi is distracted and tears her ACL. Patrick comes to see Tashi, but Tashi angrily demands he leave. Art sides with her, ending his friendship with Patrick. Art aids in Tashi\\'s recovery, but her injury ends her tennis career.\\nIn 2009, Tashi reconnects with Art, now a professional player, and becomes his coach and girlfriend. In 2011, Tashi and Art are now engaged, and Art\\'s career is on the rise. Tashi and Patrick run into each other at the Atlanta Open and have a one-night stand, which Art notices.\\nIn 2019, Tashi and Art are a wealthy power couple with a young daughter. Art is only one US Open title away from a Career Grand Slam, but has been struggling due to injury and age. Tashi enters Art as a wild card in a Challenger event in New Rochelle, New York, hoping to boost his confidence and return him to form. Patrick, who is living out of his car and scraping by on winnings from the lower circuits, happens to enter the New Rochelle Challenger as well.\\nSensing Art\\'s disillusionment, Patrick asks Tashi to coach him to a last winning season. She refuses, but keeps the slip of paper with his phone number on it. Starting at opposite ends of the seeding, Art and Patrick advance through the brackets until they find themselves facing each other in the final. The day before the final match, Patrick attempts to reconnect with Art, but Art rebuffs him.\\nThe evening before the final, Art tells Tashi he plans to retire at the end of the season whether he wins the Open or not. Tashi is unhappy, but reluctantly accepts Art\\'s decision. That night, Tashi secretly meets with Patrick to ask him to throw the match to Art, claiming it is to boost his confidence and to save their marriage. Patrick is disgusted but then agrees, and he and Tashi have a passionate argument before having sex inside his car.\\nThe day of the final, Tashi watches as Art and Patrick play. Patrick wins the first set, and Art the second. Although the match remains close, Art reaches a match point. Patrick signals that he has slept with Tashi using Art\\'s serve tell, which Tashi cannot decode. Stunned, Art allows Patrick to score to bring the match to a final tie break.\\nDuring the tie break, Art and Patrick furiously trade groundstrokes, both reminded of their passion for the sport. The rally intensifies and Art jumps for a volley at the net. As Art lunges for a final shot, he collides with Patrick over the net and the two embrace. Tashi leaps from her seat and yells, \"Come on!\".\\n\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n\\n\\n== Production ==\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nWriter Justin Kuritzkes was inspired to make a tennis film after watching the 2018 U.S. Open match between Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, in which Williams was penalized for receiving coaching from the sidelines. He had never heard of the rule and thought the fact that the player could not talk with such an important figure during the match seemed cinematic. He observed, \"What if you really had to talk about something important that went beyond tennis? Something going on with you personally?\" While doing research for the script, he read Andre Agassi\\'s memoir Open, in which Agassi recounts how his then-coach Brad Gilbert entered him into a Challenger event in Nevada. This served as inspiration for Art\\'s arc in the film.\\nKuritzkes also knew what the characters\\' origins were while writing: \"Tashi was always a Black woman. Patrick was always a very well-to-do Jewish guy, and Art was always a somewhat well-to-do WASP.\" He thought that a story about tennis with no Black characters would be weird because \"that is the story of American women\\'s tennis, if you look at all of the big superstars from the past decade\". The script landed on The Black List, an annual list of the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood, in December 2021. That same year, producing partners Amy Pascal and Rachel O\\'Connor read the script. Pascal had been wanting to work with director Luca Guadagnino for a long time, and sent him the script while he was filming the short film O Night Divine starring John C. Reilly. Guadagnino recalled, \"I had the script on set, hiding myself from John C., not showing him that I was reading while I was directing. Anyway, I found it amazing.\" In a 2022 interview with Collider, Guadagnino cited Kuritzkes\\' screenplay, Pascal, and Zendaya as inspirations for making the film. At the behest of Guadagnino, Kuritzkes modified the script to add a scene where Patrick and Art end up kissing each other: \"Luca felt it was very important that, in any love triangle, all the corners touch, and I quickly realized he meant it literally.\"\\nIn early 2022, MGM\\'s then-chairman Kevin Ulrich met with Guadagnino to discuss distributing the independently financed Bones and All. During the meeting, Guadagnino told Ulrich he was also in the midst of developing a \"sexy tennis story starring Zendaya\". Ulrich contacted Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, the then-heads of MGM, and they negotiated a two-picture deal over the next 24 hours to pick up both films. When Amazon completed its acquisition of MGM, it latter inherited the films, and Zendaya gained a $10 million paycheck as both star and producer. In February 2022, the film was announced with Zendaya, Josh O\\'Connor, and Mike Faist set to star.\\n\\n\\n=== Casting ===\\nPascal\\'s first choice to play Tashi was Zendaya, whom she knew from working on several Spider-Man films with, and passed her the script. Zendaya accepted the role, as it would be a departure from the teenagers she was used to portraying, and she felt it was the right time to move into more adult roles: \"It was nice to play a character that was not a child anymore. It was also interesting playing parts of my life that I haven\\'t experienced yet: I\\'ve not gotten married. I\\'ve not had a child. Those milestones, I don\\'t necessarily have a direct reference point for.\"\\nGuadagnino suggested Josh O\\'Connor should play the cocky Patrick. For the role of Art, Guadagnino considered West Side Story star Mike Faist, whose agent insisted he read the script; Faist then agreed to travel to London for a screen test with Zendaya. He later said, \"I thought, \\'Why not? If I don\\'t get the job, I got a trip out of it.\\'\" He thought that the audition had gone badly, but Guadagnino loved his interpretation of the character. Faist said that Guadagnino\\'s main preoccupations were that he was blond and that his body should be hairless. Faist was put off by the idea of shaving his body, but Guadagnino felt that he needed to be \"aerodynamic\" as an athlete. Zendaya stated that herself, Faist and O\\'Connor had a group chat where she was the \"mom\" of the group and that both actors made her \"feel safe and supported as a scene partner\".\\nZendaya\\'s best friend and personal assistant Darnell Appling portrayed the umpire at the New Rochelle Final. Guadagnino wanted him to sit on the umpire chair during a camera test; he thought he would just be acting as a stand-in, as he had done previously in other Zendaya projects. Guadagnino instead asked him to play the part, which he accepted with Zendaya\\'s blessing. To prepare for the role, Guadagnino asked Appling to attend umpire school. Appling spent three weeks filming his role. Paul Walter Hauser was previously offered the part but passed on it.\\n\\n\\n=== Filming ===\\nPrincipal photography began on May 3, 2022, in Boston, where a casting call took place for local residents to audition to play tennis players, general extras, and stand-ins. In preparation for their roles, Zendaya, Faist, and O\\'Connor spent three months training with pro-tennis player-turned-coach Brad Gilbert. Faist had to gain 30 pounds for the film. Gilbert, who was also a consultant on the film, said: \"Mike had to eat between 8,000 to 10,000 calories a day because they wanted him to gain weight. He was super thin. He had to work on his tennis and gain like 30 pounds. I had Zendaya in Los Angeles, so we got her on a program right away, and Josh was working, so [Faist] had the latest start.\" During training, the actors started at 6 a.m., were at the tennis center until noon, and then would act in the afternoon. Filming occurred in and around the Back Bay and East Boston neighborhoods. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom served as cinematographer. Irish fashion designer Jonathan Anderson, who at the time served as creative director of Spanish luxury brand Loewe, worked as the film\\'s costume designer. Filming wrapped on June 26, 2022.\\n\\n\\n=== Post-production ===\\nGuadagnino visited Zendaya on the set of Dune: Part Two in order to complete ADR for Challengers. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the film\\'s score, having previously worked with Guadagnino on 2022\\'s Bones and All. Guadagnino approached them to score Challengers by sending them an email that read, \"Do you want to be on my next film? It\\'s going to be super sexy.\" Post-production was completed by April 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Music ==\\n\\nThe film\\'s original score was composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. A remixed version was released in collaboration with Boys Noize.\\n\\n\\n== Release ==\\nThe film was previously set to be released on September 15, 2023, and before that August 11, 2023. The film was also scheduled to have its world premiere as the opening film of the 80th Venice International Film Festival, but was delayed and pulled out from the festival by Amazon MGM Studios due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike at the time.\\nChallengers premiered in Sydney, Australia on March 26, 2024, followed by premieres in Paris, London and at the Westwood Village Theater in Los Angeles, the latter of which had tennis player Venus Williams in attendance.\\n\\n\\n=== Theatrical ===\\nIt was released in theaters and IMAX in the United States and Canada by Amazon MGM Studios on April 26, 2024, the same month as the centennial anniversary of the founding of MGM on April 17.\\nWarner Bros. Pictures serves as the film\\'s international distributor. Although the film was initially set for a direct-to-streaming release on Amazon Prime Video in France instead of a theatrical release, the decision was reversed in January 2024, meaning the film would start streaming on the service 17 months after its initial theatrical release. The film was released there on April 24, 2024, 2 days before its release in the United States, although a spokesperson for Warner Bros. Discovery initially denied this, stating the film had not been dated for a French theatrical release yet.\\n\\n\\n=== Home media ===\\nThe film was made available on VOD on May 17, 2024. It was released on Blu-ray and DVD on July 9, 2024.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Box office ===\\nChallengers grossed $50.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $45.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $96 million.\\nIn the United States and Canada, Challengers was released alongside Boy Kills World and Unsung Hero, and was projected to gross $12–15 million from 3,477 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $6.2 million on its first day, including $1.9 million in Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $15 million, topping the box office and marking the best domestic opening weekend of Guadagnino\\'s career. In its second weekend the film made $7.9 million (a drop of 49%), finishing third behind newcomer The Fall Guy and the re-release of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. It then made $4.4 million in its third weekend.\\n\\n\\n=== Critical response ===\\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 372 critics\\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"With its trio of outstanding performers volleying their star power back and forth without ever dropping the ball, Challengers is a kinetic and sexy romp at court.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 82 out of 100, based on 64 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 77% overall positive score, with 59% saying they would definitely recommend it.\\nNPR included Challengers in its list of the best movies and TV of 2024, with critic Linda Holmes writing that \"A pounding score, adventurous editing and one of the smartest weird endings in recent memory completes a movie not quite like any other.\"\\nFilmmakers Edward Berger, Kelly Fremon Craig, Lena Dunham, Hannah Fidell, Parker Finn, Chad Hartigan, Matt Johnson, Karyn Kusama, David Lowery, JT Mollner, Lance Oppenheim, Rich Peppiatt, Daniel Scheinert, Celine Song, Nicholas Stoller and Tyler Taormina also praised the film.\\nIn June 2025, IndieWire ranked the film at number 63 on its list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far).\" In July 2025, it was one of the films voted for the \"Readers\\' Choice\" edition of The New York Times\\' list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century,\" finishing at number 109.\\n\\n\\n=== Accolades ===\\n\\nChallengers received four nominations at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy (Zendaya), Best Original Score (Reznor and Ross), and Best Original Song (\"Compress/Repress\"). The film eventually won Best Original Score. Challengers garnered fifteen nominations at the Astra Awards, winning Best Comedy or Musical at the Astra Film Awards, Best Film Editing (Marco Costa) at the Astra Creative Arts Awards, and Best Actress (Zendaya) and Best Screenplay (Kuritzkes) at the Astra Midseason Movie Awards. The film received several other nominations, including six Dorian Awards (two wins), four Critics\\' Choice Movie Awards (two wins), and two Gotham Awards (one win).\\nThe film also received the ReFrame Stamp and a Women Film Critics Circle Award for its gender-balanced production. Reznor and Ross garnered awards for their work on the score at the Critics\\' Choice Movie Awards and the Dorian Awards, and nominations at the Grammy Awards, the Hollywood Music in Media Awards, and the NAACP Image Awards. The film\\'s costume designer, Jonathan Anderson, was nominated for the Costume Designers Guild Award for Excellence in Contemporary Film, and the sound designers, Craig Berkey and Paul Carter, were nominated for the International Cinephile Society Award for Best Sound Design.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website\\nChallengers at IMDb'}]}]\n",

The tournament was played from April 11–14 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, United States. Scottie Scheffler won his second Masters and major, four strokes ahead of runner-up Ludvig Åberg, who was playing in his first major. Scheffler became the fourth-youngest two-time winner of the tournament and the second player, after Tiger Woods in 2001, to win both the Masters and The Players Championship in the same calendar year. \\n\\n\\n== Course ==\\n\\nThe only change to the course for the 2024 tournament was the lengthening of the second hole by ten yards.\\n\\n\\n== Field ==\\nParticipation in the Masters Tournament is by invitation only, and the tournament has the smallest field of the major championships. There are a number of criteria by which invitations are awarded, including all past winners, recent major champions, leading finishers in the previous year's majors, leading players on the PGA Tour in the previous season, winners of full-point tournaments on the PGA Tour during the previous 12 months, leading players in the Official World Golf Ranking, and some leading amateurs.\\n\\n\\n=== Criteria ===\\nThere were three changes to invitee criteria between the 2023 and 2024 tournaments. The first was to add the current NCAA Division I Men's Individual Champion a spot in the field, provided that he remains an amateur at the time of the tournament. In addition, Augusta National clarified that players who qualify for the Tour Championship must remain eligible to play in that event in order to qualify for the Masters. Also, with the PGA Tour returning to a calendar-year season schedule, Augusta National noted that winners of fall PGA Tour events would continue to qualify for the Masters.\\nThe below list details the qualification criteria for the 2024 Masters Tournament and the players who have qualified under them; any additional criteria under which players qualified are indicated in parentheses.\\n1.

There were five holes-in-one recorded, by Sepp Straka, Luke List, Gary Woodland, Viktor Hovland, and Lucas Glover.\\n\\n\\n== Round summaries ==\\n\\n\\n=== First round ===\\nThursday, April 11, 2024Friday, April 12, 2024\\nInclement weather delayed the start of the tournament until 10:30 am Eastern time. As a result, 27 players did not complete the first round on Thursday.\\nThe 8th hole, a par 5, saw a record-breaking total of 53 par-breaking scores, including 50 birdies and 3 eagles, the highest ever recorded on this hole in Masters history. \\n\\n\\n=== Second round ===\\nFriday, April 12, 2024\\nBy making the cut, Tiger Woods set the record for most consecutive cuts made at the Masters, at 24. Phil Mickelson made the cut for the 28th time, surpassing Raymond Floyd and Bernhard Langer to move into solo fourth place for most cuts made at the Masters, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (37), Fred Couples (31) and Gary Player (30).\\nRookie Ludvig Åberg posted the lowest score of the round, a 69, and advanced to a solo 7th place.\\nBryson DeChambeau, before making a birdie on the 13th hole, moved a large directional sign that was in his line of play.\\nPatrick Cantlay achieved two eagles on par 4s, marking only the fourth instance in history that a player has recorded two par-4 eagles in a single Masters Tournament, the last being Brandt Jobe in 2006.\\nThe cut came at 150 (+6), with 60 players advancing to the weekend. Notables to miss the cut included 2015 champion Jordan Spieth, 2020 champion Dustin Johnson, reigning U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark, Open champion Brian Harman, and World No. 6 Viktor Hovland. Two-time major champion Justin Thomas played his last four holes in seven-over to miss the cut by one shot.\\n\\n\\n=== Third round ===\\nSaturday, April 13, 2024\\nScottie Scheffler, beginning the round in a three-way tie for the lead, chipped in for birdie on the first hole. After a double bogey on the 10th, Scheffler holed a 31-foot eagle putt on the par-five 13th, the only eagle recorded on that hole during the round. He also birdied the 15th and 18th to finish at seven under following a 71 (−1) to take a one-shot lead into the final round.\\nCollin Morikawa birdied his first three holes in a three-under round of 69 and finished at six under, one shot back of Scheffler. Max Homa, tied for the lead at the start of the round, didn't make a birdie in a one-over 73 and fell two back at 5 under. Bryson DeChambeau was also atop the leaderboard to begin the round but hit his third shot in the water on the 15th and made double bogey. He holed out for birdie on the 18th to finish at three under and four shots back of Scheffler. Ludvig Åberg, making his Masters and major championship debut, was four under on his round until a bogey at the 14th. He then left his third shot on the 15th short and three-putted from just off the green for another bogey. He shot 70 (–2) and ended up at four under.\\nNicolai Højgaard moved into sole possession of the lead following a run of three straight birdies from holes 8 to 10, but he then made five straight bogeys including hitting into the water on both the 13th and 15th and finished at two under.\\nTiger Woods carded a 10-over-par 82 for the third round, his highest score ever in a major championship.\\nNo eagles were recorded on the par-5 15th hole through the first three rounds, marking only the second time in the past 50 years that No. 15 has failed to produce an eagle by this point in the tournament. Shane Lowry scored an eagle on the par-4 14th hole, marking the first eagle on this hole since Martin Kaymer in 2016.\\n\\n\\n=== Final round ===\\nSunday, April 14, 2024\\n\\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler shot a four-under 68 to win his second Masters title in the last three years by four shots over runner-up Ludvig Åberg.\\nScheffler began the round with a one-shot lead and birdied the third hole to go two shots ahead. He then bogeyed the fourth after hitting his tee shot over the green. Max Homa birdied the second, his first birdie in 34 holes, to get within one of the lead, while Åberg hit his approach on the seventh to four feet and made birdie to also get within one of the lead.\\nScheffler bogeyed the seventh to create a three-way tie with Åberg and Collin Morikawa at six under, while Homa joined the lead with a two-putt birdie at the par-five eighth. Both Scheffler and Morikawa birdied the eighth to get to seven under, while Åberg holed a 36-foot birdie putt on the ninth to again tie. Scheffler then hit his approach on the ninth to within a foot for another birdie to get to 8 under and again in sole possession of the lead going to the second nine.\\nAll three challengers then fell from contention. Morikawa hit his second shot on the ninth into a greenside bunker and couldn't advance on his third, ending up with a double bogey to fall three shots behind. He found the water on his approach at the 11th and made another double bogey. Åberg also hit into the water on the 11th for a double bogey. Homa got back within one with a close approach to the 10th, but his tee shot on the 12th flew over the green into the bushes and he was forced to take a drop. He made a double bogey on the hole to fall three shots behind.\\nScheffler birdied the 10th, his third birdie in a row, to get to nine under and open a two-shot lead. Despite a bogey on the 11th, Scheffler two-putted for birdie at the par-five 13th and hit his second shot on the 14th to within four feet for another birdie to reach 10 under. He then made a nine-foot birdie putt on the par-three 16th to get to 11 under. Pars on his final two holes allowed him to close out the tournament with a four-shot victory.\\nÅberg birdied the 13th and 14th to get back to seven under and finish four back of Scheffler in his Masters and major championship debut. Morikawa and Homa both finished at four under for the tournament, in a tie for third place along with Tommy Fleetwood.\\n\\n\\n==== Scorecard ====\\n\\nCumulative tournament scores, relative to par\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\"}]}]\n",
